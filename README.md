# WP Selectize

WP Selectize implements the [Selectize.js jQuery Plugin](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) for WordPress.

[Selectize.js](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly. It also has a lot more functionality than Chosen.

This project is based off of [WP Chosen](https://github.com/stuttter/wp-chosen)

# Installation

* Download and install using the built in WordPress plugin installer.
