# WP Selectize

WP Selectize implements the [Selectize.js jQuery Plugin](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) for WordPress.

[Selectize.js](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/) makes long, unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly. It also has a lot more functionality than Chosen.

This project is based off of [WP Chosen](https://github.com/stuttter/wp-chosen)

# Installation

* Download and install using the built in WordPress plugin installer.
* Activate in the "Plugins" area of your admin by clicking the "Activate" link.
* No further setup or configuration is necessary.

This plugin ignores the WP Lang Field because I can't get it to work on that and I was in a rush.

### Can I contribute?

Yes, please!
